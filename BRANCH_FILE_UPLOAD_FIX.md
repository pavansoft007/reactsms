# Branch File Upload Fix Summary

## Problem

- ENOENT error when uploading files for branches
- Files not being saved properly
- Missing upload directory structure

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Missing upload directory**: The `server/uploads/branches/` directory didn't exist
2. **Missing database columns**: The branch model didn't have file column definitions
3. **Incomplete file handling**: Controller wasn't processing uploaded files correctly

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Created Upload Directory Structure

```
server/uploads/
├── branches/        (for branch logos and files)
├── students/        (for student documents)
├── teachers/        (for teacher documents)
└── documents/       (for general documents)
```

### 2. Enhanced Multer Middleware (`server/middleware/multer.middleware.js`)

- Added automatic directory creation with `fs.mkdirSync({ recursive: true })`
- Ensured upload directory exists before file operations
- Configured proper file naming with timestamps and random suffixes

### 3. Updated Branch Model (`server/models/branch.model.js`)

Added new file columns:

- `logo_file`: Logo file name
- `text_logo`: Text logo file name
- `print_file`: Print header file name
- `report_card`: Report card template file name

### 4. Enhanced Branch Controller (`server/controllers/branch.controller.js`)

#### Create Function

- Added file handling logic to process uploaded files
- Extract file names from `req.files` object
- Include file fields in branch creation

#### Update Function

- Added file handling for updates
- Preserve existing files if no new files uploaded
- Update file fields when new files are provided

### 5. Database Migration

- Created and ran migration to add file columns to existing branches table
- All columns are nullable to maintain backward compatibility

### 6. Route Configuration Verified

- Confirmed both POST `/api/branches` and PUT `/api/branches/:id` routes use `branchUpload` middleware
- File upload middleware properly configured for multiple file types

## File Upload Fields Supported

- `logo_file`: Branch logo image
- `text_logo`: Text-based logo file
- `print_file`: Print header template
- `report_card`: Report card template

## Testing Steps

1. Create/update a branch with file uploads
2. Verify files are saved to `server/uploads/branches/`
3. Check database contains correct file names
4. Verify files can be retrieved via appropriate endpoints

## Error Prevention

- Directory auto-creation prevents ENOENT errors
- Proper file validation and error handling
- Transaction rollback on upload failures
- Graceful handling of missing files

The file upload system is now robust and should handle all branch file operations correctly.
