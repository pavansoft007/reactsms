# Top Bar School Info Display Enhancement

## Overview

Enhanced the TopBarUltra component to fetch and display school name and logo from the branches table, providing a dynamic school branding experience in the top navigation bar.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Integration

**File: `client/src/layout/TopBarUltra.tsx`**

- Updated `fetchSchoolInfo()` function to properly fetch branch data
- Enhanced field mapping to use correct database column names:
  - `school_name` (primary), `branch_name`, or `name` for school name
  - `logo_file` for main logo, `text_logo` as fallback

### 2. Logo File Serving

**File: `server/routes/branch.routes.js`**

- Added file serving endpoints for branch assets:
  - `GET /api/branches/logo/:filename` - Serves logo files
  - `GET /api/branches/text-logo/:filename` - Serves text logo files
  - `GET /api/branches/print/:filename` - Serves print header files
  - `GET /api/branches/report-card/:filename` - Serves report card templates
- Added proper file existence checking and error handling

### 3. Enhanced Logo Display

**File: `client/src/layout/TopBarUltra.tsx`**

- Improved logo URL construction: `/api/branches/logo/${filename}`
- Added fallback logic: logo_file → text_logo → default icon
- Enhanced error handling for failed logo loading
- Maintains responsive design with 32px avatar size

### 4. School Name Priority

Updated field priority for school name display:

1. `branch.school_name` (primary field for school name)
2. `branch.branch_name` (secondary field)
3. `branch.name` (fallback field)
4. "School" (default fallback)

## API Endpoints Added

```javascript
// Logo files
GET /api/branches/logo/:filename

// Text logo files
GET /api/branches/text-logo/:filename

// Print header files
GET /api/branches/print/:filename

// Report card templates
GET /api/branches/report-card/:filename
```

## UI Features

### School Logo Display

- **With Logo**: Shows uploaded school logo as 32px circular avatar
- **Without Logo**: Shows blue gradient background with school icon
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully falls back to default icon on load failure

### School Name Display

- Fetches from branches table `school_name` column
- Displays in modern typography with proper spacing
- Falls back to default "Excellence Academy" if no data found

### Dynamic Updates

- Automatically fetches school info on component mount
- Uses user's branch ID from localStorage when available
- Falls back to first available branch for multi-branch systems

## Technical Implementation

### Branch Data Fetching

```typescript
const branchResponse = await axios.get("/api/branches", {
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` },
});

const userBranchId = localStorage.getItem("user_branch_id");
const branch = userBranchId
  ? branchResponse.data.find((b) => b.id.toString() === userBranchId)
  : branchResponse.data[0];
```

### Logo URL Construction

```typescript
let logoUrl = undefined;
if (branch.logo_file) {
  logoUrl = `/api/branches/logo/${branch.logo_file}`;
} else if (branch.text_logo) {
  logoUrl = `/api/branches/text-logo/${branch.text_logo}`;
}
```

## File Structure

```
server/uploads/branches/
├── logo-files...        (served via /api/branches/logo/:filename)
├── text-logo-files...   (served via /api/branches/text-logo/:filename)
├── print-files...       (served via /api/branches/print/:filename)
└── report-cards...      (served via /api/branches/report-card/:filename)
```

## Benefits

1. **Dynamic Branding**: Each branch can have its own logo and name
2. **Responsive Design**: Logo and name adapt to different screen sizes
3. **Error Resilience**: Graceful fallbacks when files are missing
4. **Multi-Branch Support**: Displays appropriate branch data per user
5. **Modern UI**: Maintains consistent design language with rest of application

This enhancement provides a professional, branded experience where each school branch can display its unique identity in the top navigation bar.
