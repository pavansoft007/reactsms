# TopBar Dynamic School Info Fix

## Problem

TopBar was displaying static school name "Excellence Academy" instead of the dynamic school name fetched from the branches table.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Static Props Override**: DoubleNavbarUltra was passing static props (`schoolName="Excellence Academy"`) to TopBarUltra, which took precedence over fetched data.

2. **Incorrect API Response Parsing**: The code was trying to access `branchResponse.data` as an array, but the actual API response structure is:

   ```json
   {
     "success": true,
     "data": [branches_array]  // <-- The branches are nested here
   }
   ```

3. **Poor Fallback Logic**: The fallback logic prioritized static props over fetched data during loading states.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Removed Static Props

**File: `client/src/layout/DoubleNavbarUltra.tsx`**

```tsx
// Before
<TopBarUltra
  schoolName="Excellence Academy"
  schoolLogo="/api/placeholder/40/40"
/>

// After
<TopBarUltra />
```

### 2. Fixed API Response Parsing

**File: `client/src/layout/TopBarUltra.tsx`**

```tsx
// Before
if (branchResponse.data && branchResponse.data.length > 0) {
  const branch = branchResponse.data[0];

// After
if (branchResponse.data.success && branchResponse.data.data && branchResponse.data.data.length > 0) {
  const branch = branchResponse.data.data[0];
```

### 3. Enhanced Loading State Management

- Added `isLoadingSchoolInfo` state to track loading status
- Improved fallback logic to prioritize fetched data
- Added comprehensive debug logging

### 4. Improved Display Logic

```tsx
// Better fallback logic that doesn't rely on static props
const displaySchoolName =
  schoolInfo?.name ||
  (!isLoadingSchoolInfo ? "School Management System" : "Loading...");
```

### 5. Enhanced Error Handling

- Added detailed console logging for debugging
- Better error messages and fallback handling
- Loading states to show progress

## API Response Structure

The `/api/branches` endpoint returns:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Branches retrieved successfully",
  "totalItems": 1,
  "totalPages": 1,
  "currentPage": 1,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Branch Name",
      "school_name": "Actual School Name",
      "branch_name": "Branch Display Name",
      "logo_file": "logo-filename.png",
      "text_logo": "text-logo-filename.png"
      // ... other fields
    }
  ]
}
```

## Field Priority for School Name

1. `branch.school_name` (primary field)
2. `branch.branch_name` (secondary field)
3. `branch.name` (tertiary field)
4. "School Management System" (default fallback)

## Field Priority for Logo

1. `branch.logo_file` → `/api/branches/logo/${filename}`
2. `branch.text_logo` → `/api/branches/text-logo/${filename}`
3. Default gradient icon with school icon

## Debug Information Added

The TopBar now logs detailed information to console:

- API response structure
- Selected branch data
- User branch ID from localStorage
- Final school info object
- Loading states

## Testing Steps

1. Open browser developer console
2. Refresh the page
3. Check console logs for:
   - "Fetching school info from /api/branches..."
   - "Branch response: {...}"
   - "Selected branch: {...}"
   - "Setting school info: {...}"
   - "TopBarUltra render: {...}"

If the school name is still static, check:

1. Is the API call succeeding?
2. Is the branch data in the expected format?
3. Are there any console errors?
4. Is the user authenticated (token exists)?

The TopBar should now dynamically display the school name from the branches table instead of the static "Excellence Academy" text.
